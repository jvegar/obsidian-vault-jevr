The `.zshenv` file is a configuration file used by the **Z shell (zsh)**. It serves a specific purpose in the zsh initialization process:

### Purpose of `.zshenv`:
1. **Environment Variables** – It is primarily used to set **environment variables** that should be available in all zsh sessions, including:
   - Interactive shells (when you open a terminal)
   - Non-interactive shells (scripts, commands run via `zsh -c`)
   - Even when `--no-rcs` is used (unless `--no-globalrcs` is specified)

2. **Global Settings** – It is the **first** zsh configuration file loaded, making it ideal for:
   - Setting `PATH`, `EDITOR`, `LANG`, etc.
   - Defining aliases or functions needed in all contexts.
   - Configuring behavior that should apply even when `.zshrc` is not loaded.

### Key Differences from `.zshrc`:
- `.zshenv` is loaded **before** `.zshrc`.
- `.zshrc` is only for **interactive** shells, while `.zshenv` applies to **all** zsh instances.
- `.zshenv` is sourced even in non-login shells, whereas `.zprofile` is only for login shells.

### When to Use `.zshenv` vs Other Files:
| File          | Loaded When? | Best For |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| `.zshenv`    | Always (unless `--no-globalrcs`) | Environment variables, universal settings |
| `.zshrc`     | Interactive shells only | Shell behavior, aliases, prompts |
| `.zprofile`  | Login shells only | Commands that should run once per login |
| `.zlogin`    | After `.zshrc` in login shells | Post-initialization tasks |

### Example `.zshenv` Contents:
```sh
# Set PATH additions
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

# Default editor
export EDITOR="nvim"

# Language settings
export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

# Custom function available everywhere
function myfunc() { echo "Hello from .zshenv!"; }
```

### Best Practices:
- Keep `.zshenv` minimal (only what must be available everywhere).
- Avoid heavy computations or output (since it runs even in scripts).
- Prefer `.zshrc` for interactive-only customizations.
