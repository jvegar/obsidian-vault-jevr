In Vim, the command `:set opt?` is used to display the current value of a specific option (`opt` in this case).

### Breakdown:
- `:set` is the command used to view or modify Vim options.
- `opt` should be replaced with an actual option name (e.g., `:set number?`, `:set tabstop?`).
- The `?` at the end means "display the current value of this option."

### Example:
If you run `:set number?`, Vim will show something like:
```
number
```
(if line numbers are enabled) or:
```
nonumber
```
(if line numbers are disabled).

### Notes:
1. If you literally type `:set opt?` (where `opt` is not replaced with an actual option name), Vim will show an error like:
   ```
   E518: Unknown option: opt
   ```
   because `opt` is not a valid Vim option.

2. Common options you might check this way include:
   - `number`/`nonumber` (line numbers)
   - `tabstop=4` (tab width)
   - `expandtab`/`noexpandtab` (spaces vs. tabs)
   - `paste`/`nopaste` (paste mode)
