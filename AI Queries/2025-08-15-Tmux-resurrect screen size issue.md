Of course. This is an excellent and common question for `tmux-resurrect` users. Let's break down exactly why this happens and how to fix it.

### The Short Answer (TL;DR)

This message appears because of a **race condition**. When your terminal starts, `tmux-resurrect` tries to restore your session *so quickly* that the terminal hasn't yet had time to tell the system its actual size (e.g., 120 columns by 40 rows).

`tmux` asks for the terminal size, gets a bogus default value (like `131072x1`), and correctly complains about it. A fraction of a second later, the terminal reports its real size, and `tmux` resizes everything correctly, which is why things usually look fine despite the warning.

### The Detailed Explanation

To understand this, let's walk through the sequence of events when you open a terminal that's configured to auto-restore a `tmux` session.

#### The Analogy: Movers at a New House

Imagine you've hired movers (`tmux-resurrect`) to set up your furniture in a brand-new house. You've also hired an inspector to measure the rooms and provide the final blueprints.

1.  The movers are incredibly fast. They show up the moment the doors are unlocked.
2.  They immediately ask, "What are the dimensions of the living room?"
3.  The inspector hasn't finished measuring yet, so he hands them a default placeholder blueprint that says the room is "100 miles long and 1 inch wide."
4.  The head mover looks at this and says, "**This `100 miles x 1 inch` room size is bogus. Expect trouble.**"
5.  A moment later, the inspector finishes and hands them the correct blueprint ("15 feet x 20 feet"). The movers then arrange the furniture perfectly.

The initial warning was valid, but the problem corrected itself almost instantly. This is exactly what's happening with `tmux`.

#### The Technical Breakdown

1.  **Terminal Starts:** You launch your terminal emulator (e.g., Alacritty, Kitty, iTerm2, Gnome Terminal).
2.  **Shell Starts:** Your shell (`bash`, `zsh`, etc.) begins to load its configuration files (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`).
3.  **Tmux-Resurrect Kicks In:** You likely have a command in your shell's config file to automatically run `tmux-continuum`'s restore script, or you're running it manually. This script immediately starts firing off `tmux` commands to rebuild your last session (`tmux new-window`, `tmux split-pane`, etc.).
4.  **The Race:** The script asks the `tmux` server to create a new session and attach to it. To draw the session, `tmux` needs to know the size of the client (your terminal). It queries the operating system's TTY (teletype) layer for the dimensions.
5.  **The Bogus Value:** Because this is happening within milliseconds of the terminal launching, the terminal emulator may not have had time to properly initialize and communicate its window dimensions to the OS. The OS, when asked, provides a default or uninitialized value. The `131072x1` size is a common placeholder value from the kernel's pseudoterminal (PTY) subsystem.
6.  **Tmux Complains:** `tmux` receives this nonsensical `131072x1` value. It knows this can't be right and prints the warning: `your 131072x1 screen size is bogus. expect trouble`.
7.  **Correction:** Almost immediately after, the terminal emulator finishes its startup, calculates its real size, and notifies the OS. The OS sends a `SIGWINCH` (Window Change) signal to `tmux`. `tmux` catches this signal, re-queries the size, gets the correct dimensions, and redraws all your windows and panes perfectly.

### How to Fix It

The solution is to simply introduce a tiny delay before `tmux-resurrect` tries to restore the session, giving your terminal emulator a moment to get its bearings.

#### The Most Common and Effective Solution

The best way to do this is by adding a small `sleep` to the command that restores your session. This command is usually managed by the `tmux-continuum` plugin.

1.  Open your `tmux` configuration file (usually `~/.tmux.conf`).
2.  Find the line related to `tmux-resurrect`'s restore command. If you don't have one, add it.
3.  Modify or add the command to include a short sleep.

```tmux
# ~/.tmux.conf

# Add a small delay to the restore command to prevent the "bogus screen size" error
# This gives the terminal emulator time to report its size.
set -g @resurrect-restore 'sleep 0.5 && ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-resurrect/scripts/restore.sh'

# Or if you use tmux-continuum to auto-restore
set -g @continuum-restore 'on'
set -g @continuum-restore-command 'sleep 0.5 && ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-resurrect/scripts/restore.sh'

# (Your other tmux plugins and settings...)
# Example: List of plugins for TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager)
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-sensible'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'

# Initialize TPM (keep this at the very bottom of your tmux.conf)
run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'
```

**Explanation:**

*   `sleep 0.5`: This tells the shell to wait for half a second. This is usually more than enough time for any modern terminal to initialize. You can adjust this value (e.g., `sleep 1` if you're still seeing it, or `sleep 0.2` if you want it to be faster).
*   `&&`: This ensures that the restore script only runs if the `sleep` command completes successfully.

After adding this to your `.tmux.conf`, either restart `tmux` completely or reload the configuration by pressing `prefix` + `I` (if you're using TPM) or by running `tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf` inside `tmux`. The next time you start a new terminal, the error should be gone.
