#### How (Neo)Vim and Markdown revolutionized my data engineering and writing workflow

In my journey, detailed in [Why Vim is More Than Just an Editor]. I've discovered the profound impact of integrating Vim and its motions into my entire computer workflow. This evolution, from using familiar tools like Notepad++ and SQL Server Management Studio to embracing Vim, represents a significant shift in how I approach tasks in data engineering and writing.

This blog post delves into how this transition to Vim, coupled with a step-by-step adoption of Markdown, has streamlined my process. Moving away from the limitations of WYSIWYG editors, I've embraced the simplicity and power of Markdown, as explored in my piece on [Markdown vs Rich Text].

From the early days of learning editor shortcuts in VS Code to the moment I discovered the efficiency of Vim's model editing, my journey has been about finding clarity in my work. This path has led to significant changes in my writing process, including the adoption of Obsidian for my Second Brain, and expanding Vim's use to other applications, enhancing my productivity and creativity.

I share insights from my transition, showcasing how Vim's motions and Markdown can revolutionize your workflow, just as have mine.

#### Where I Came From
I started with procedural database instruction with PL - or - TS-SQL. Editors such as Notepad++, UltraEdit, or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) were my friends. Later, I discovered many more, such as Sublime, Eclipse, Netbeans, Sublime, TextMate, and VS Code.

#### OS-wide Shortcuts
I was pretty efficient; I learned how to `crtl+shift+end` and use arrow keys to select lines to jump with `shift+option+ ->` or `shift+option+ <-` to select by words, both on Mac and Windows. Other shortcuts I only used a little as I wasn't a proficient programmer.

However, I learned advanced features that I used and discovered constantly. These were features such as the column-edit feature in Notepad++ to extract columns, remove/add columns, or do another batch kind of work.

#### Editor Shortcuts
Once VS Code became famous, I loved the `cmd+shift+p` shortcut to fuzzy find all commands. I felt way more productive in everyday tasks. Afterward, I added separate hotkeys for each command I used often, skipping the cmd+shift+p. Also, `cmd+p` to open and fuzzy find files was a big game-changer quickly.

At some point, I couldn't get any faster. I was much faster than most of my co-workers, or so I thought. The problem was that I lost my productivity whenever I switched to another editor, program, or app. I had to do a lot of copy-pasting. Whenever I switched editors to a newer, better one, I had to re-learn all shortcuts and mappings. They were different on every tool. Sure, I tried to align them, but it was a lot of work, and I couldn't recreate my old habits a hundred percent.

#### Entering Writing. Wordpress.
At the same time, I started to write more publicly on my Blog, and I had to constantly copy my text from something my Google Docs or editor I used to the WordPress editors. I also wrote directly in WordPress but I didn't do it anymore after losing some of my text of limited functionality.

I mostly wrote the text in my Second Brain, which at that time was Microsoft OneNote. But every time I wanted to publish, I had to ensure all my formatting was copied and the images looked okay. It was always a hassle. I had maintained two versions of the same, one locally and one on WordPress.

The worst part was that it was a pain if I wanted to fix errors or update my content. And I generally didn't do it, even though I fancied the idea of constantly updating content back then, too.

#### How I Discovered Vim
At some random point, I discovered something called Vim. I saw it from a co-worker before, but I thought he needed to include more features from VS Code I sued back then, and as he didn't customize anything, it looked awful and not something I could ever work with.

But I was impressed with the macros and how he would temper the CSV or batch-fix files from the cmd line. Or how he instantly created Python scripts and ran them without leaving the terminal. You know, the hacker feeling we all want, I saw there.

But I was not into it yet. It was much later when I saw another co-worker who used Linux only and had great Dotfiles setup.

#### Why It Sticked
What grew over time on me was editing philosophy, also called [Vim Language (and Motions)](https://ssp.sh/brain/vim-language-and-motions). Instead of clicking with the mouse to specific part to fix grammar or change a variable, in Vim motions, you jump there with a critical command and have another one to change after/before/surround a word. For each different edit, there was a command. I was hooked to lear more. That's how a surgeon would work: fine-grained and filigree, but with words.

As I worked on a computer all day,  I went in rabbit holes with custom keyboards, different keyboard layouts such as Halmak, and fancied custom color themes. I have custom shortcuts for each edit I want.
