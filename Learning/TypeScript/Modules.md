#JavaScript #modules


JavaScript has a long history of different ways to handle modularizing code. Having been around since **2012**, TypeScript has implemented support for a lot of these formats, but over time the community and the JavaScript specification has **==converged==** on a format called **ES Modules** (or ES6 modules). You might know it as the `import`/`export` syntax.

ES Modules was added to the JavaScript spec in **2015**, and by 2020 had broad support in most web browsers and JavaScript runtimes.

For focus, the handbook will cover both ES Modules and its popular pre-cursor _CommonJS_ `module.exports =` syntax, and you can find information about the other module patterns in the reference section under [Modules](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html).

## How JavaScript Modules are Defined

In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, ==_any file containing a top-level `import` or `export` is considered a module_==.

Conversely, _a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script_ whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).

_Modules_ are **executed within their own scope**, not in the global scope. This means that variables, functions, classes, etc. declared in a module are not visible outside the module unless they are explicitly exported using one of the export forms. Conversely, to consume a variable, function, class, interface, etc. exported from a different module, it has to be imported using one of the import forms.

## Non-modules

Before we start, itâ€™s important to understand what TypeScript considers a module. The JavaScript specification declares that _==any JavaScript files without an `import` declaration, `export`, or top-level `await` should be considered a **script** and not a module==_.

Inside a _script file variables and types are declared to be in the **shared global scope**_, and itâ€™s assumed that youâ€™ll either _use the [`outFile`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#outFile) compiler option to join **multiple input files** into one output file_, or use multiple `<script>` tags in your HTML to load these files (in the correct order!).

If you have a file that doesnâ€™t currently have any `import`s or `export`s, but you want to be treated as a module, add the line:

`   export {};   `[Try](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/KYDwDg9gTgLgBAbwL4G4g)

which will change the file to be a module exporting nothing. This syntax works regardless of your module target.

> [MDN: JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)  

There are three main things to consider when writing module-based code in TypeScript:

- **Syntax**: What syntax do I want to use to import and export things?
- **Module Resolution**: What is the relationship between module names (or paths) and files on disk?
- **Module Output Target**: What should my emitted JavaScript module look like?

### ES Module Syntax

A file can declare a _main export_ via **`export default`**:

```TS
// @filename: hello.ts
export default function helloWorld() {    
	console.log("Hello, world!");  
}
```   
This is then imported via:
```TS
import helloWorld from "./hello.js";
helloWorld();
```

In addition to the default export, you can have more than one export of variables and functions via the `export` by omitting `default`:
```TS
// @filename: maths.ts
export var pi = 3.14;
export let squareTwo = 1.41;
export const phi = 1.61;
 
export class RandomNumberGenerator {}
 
export function absolute(num: number) {
  if (num < 0) return num * -1;
  return num;
}
```
These can be used in another file via the `import` syntax:
```TS
import { pi, phi, absolute } from "./maths.js";
 
console.log(pi);
const absPhi = absolute(phi);
```
### Additional Import Syntax

An import can be renamed using a format like `import {old as new}`:
```TS
import { pi as Ï€ } from "./maths.js";
 
console.log(Ï€);
```
You can mix and match the above syntax into a single `import`:
```TS
// @filename: maths.ts
export const pi = 3.14;
export default class RandomNumberGenerator {}
 
// @filename: app.ts
import RandomNumberGenerator, { pi as Ï€ } from "./maths.js";
 
RandomNumberGenerator; 
console.log(Ï€);
```

You can take all of the exported objects and put them into a single namespace using `* as name`:
```TS
// @filename: app.ts
import * as math from "./maths.js";
 
console.log(math.pi);
const positivePhi = math.absolute(math.phi);
```

You can import a file and _not_ include any variables into your current module via `import "./file"`:
```TS
// @filename: app.ts
import "./maths.js";
 
console.log("3.14");
```
In this case, the `import` does nothing. However, all of the code in `maths.ts` was evaluated, which could trigger side-effects which affect other objects.

#### TypeScript Specific ES Module Syntax

Types can be exported and imported using the same syntax as JavaScript values:
```TS
// @filename: animal.ts
export type Cat = { breed: string; yearOfBirth: number };
 
export interface Dog {
  breeds: string[];
  yearOfBirth: number;
}
 
// @filename: app.ts
import { Cat, Dog } from "./animal.js";
type Animals = Cat | Dog;
```
TypeScript has extended the `import` syntax with two concepts for declaring an import of a type:
```TS
import type
```
Which is an import statement which can _only_ import types:
```TS
// @filename: animal.ts
export type Cat = { breed: string; yearOfBirth: number };
export type Dog = { breeds: string[]; yearOfBirth: number };
export const createCatName = () => "fluffy";Â 
// @filename: valid.ts
import type { Cat, Dog } from "./animal.js";
export type Animals = Cat | Dog;Â 
// @filename: app.ts
import type { createCatName } from "./animal.js";
const name = createCatName();
/*
'createCatName' cannot be used as a value because it was imported using 'import type'
*/.
```

```TS
inline type imports
```

TypeScript 4.5 also allows for individual imports to be prefixed with `type` to indicate that the imported reference is a type:
```TS
// @filename: app.ts
import { createCatName, type Cat, type Dog } from "./animal.js";
 
export type Animals = Cat | Dog;
const name = createCatName();
```
Together these allow a non-TypeScript transpiler like _Babel_, _swc_ or _esbuild_ to know what imports can be safely removed.

#### ES Module Syntax with CommonJS Behavior

TypeScript has ES Module syntax which _directly_ correlates to a CommonJS and AMD `require`. Imports using ES Module are _for most cases_ the same as the `require` from those environments, but this syntax ensures you have a 1 to 1 match in your TypeScript file with the CommonJS output:
```TS
import fs = require("fs");
const code = fs.readFileSync("hello.ts", "utf8");
```
You can learn more about this syntax in the [modules reference page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#export--and-import--require).

## CommonJS Syntax

CommonJS is the format which most modules on npm are delivered in. Even if you are writing using the ES Modules syntax above, having a brief understanding of how CommonJS syntax works will help you debug easier.
#### Exporting

Identifiers are exported via setting the `exports` property on a global called `module`.
```TS
function absolute(num: number) {
  if (num < 0) return num * -1;
  return num;
}
 
module.exports = {
  pi: 3.14,
  squareTwo: 1.41,
  phi: 1.61,
  absolute,
};
```
Then these files can be imported via a `require` statement:
```TS
const maths = require("./maths");
maths.pi;
```
Or you can simplify a bit using the destructuring feature in JavaScript:
```TS
const { squareTwo } = require("./maths");
squareTwo;
```
### CommonJS and ES Modules interop

There is a mis-match in features between CommonJS and ES Modules regarding the distinction between a default import and a module namespace object import. TypeScript has a compiler flag to reduce the friction between the two different sets of constraints with [`esModuleInterop`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop).
## TypeScriptâ€™s Module Resolution Options

==_Module resolution_== is the process of ==taking a string from the `import` or `require` statement, and determining what file that string refers to==.

TypeScript includes two resolution strategies: Classic and Node. Classic, the default when the compiler option [`module`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module) is not `commonjs`, is included for backwards compatibility. The Node strategy replicates how Node.js works in CommonJS mode, with additional checks for `.ts` and `.d.ts`.

There are many TSConfig flags which influence the module strategy within TypeScript: [`moduleResolution`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution), [`baseUrl`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#baseUrl), [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths), [`rootDirs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#rootDirs).

For the full details on how these strategies work, you can consult the [Module Resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/reference.html#the-moduleresolution-compiler-option) reference page.
## TypeScriptâ€™s Module Output Options

There are two options which affect the emitted JavaScript output:

- [`target`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target) which determines which JS features are downleveled (converted to run in older JavaScript runtimes) and which are left intact
- [`module`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module) which determines what code is used for modules to interact with each other

Which [`target`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#target) you use is determined by the features available in the JavaScript runtime you expect to run the TypeScript code in. That could be: the oldest web browser you support, the lowest version of Node.js you expect to run on or could come from unique constraints from your runtime - like Electron for example.

All communication between modules happens via a module loader, the compiler option [`module`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module) determines which one is used. At runtime the module loader is responsible for locating and executing all dependencies of a module before executing it.

For example, here is a TypeScript file using ES Modules syntax, showcasing a few different options for [`module`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module):
```TS
import { valueOfPi } from "./constants.js";
 
export const twoPi = valueOfPi * 2;
```
#### `ES2020`
```TS
import { valueOfPi } from "./constants.js";
export const twoPi = valueOfPi * 2;
```
#### `CommonJS`
```JS
"use strict";
Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
exports.twoPi = void 0;
const constants_js_1 = require("./constants.js");
exports.twoPi = constants_js_1.valueOfPi * 2;
```
#### `UMD`
```JS
(function (factory) {
    if (typeof module === "object" && typeof module.exports === "object") {
        var v = factory(require, exports);
        if (v !== undefined) module.exports = v;
    }
    else if (typeof define === "function" && define.amd) {
        define(["require", "exports", "./constants.js"], factory);
    }
})(function (require, exports) {
    "use strict";
    Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
    exports.twoPi = void 0;
    const constants_js_1 = require("./constants.js");
    exports.twoPi = constants_js_1.valueOfPi * 2;
});
```

> Note that ES2020 is effectively the same as the original `index.ts`.

You can see all of the available options and what their emitted JavaScript code looks like in the [TSConfig Reference for `module`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#module).

## TypeScript namespaces

TypeScript has its own module format called `namespaces` which pre-dates the ES Modules standard. This syntax has a lot of useful features for creating complex definition files, and still sees active use [in DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped). While not deprecated, the majority of the features in namespaces exist in ES Modules and we recommend you use that to align with JavaScriptâ€™s direction. You can learn more about namespaces in [the namespaces reference page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html).
