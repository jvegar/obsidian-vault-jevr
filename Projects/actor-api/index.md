# Tutorial: actor-api

The `actor-api` is a microservice designed to **manage and expose structured data** about core entities called 'actors' (like people and companies). It provides a **public API** for clients to query and modify this actor data and includes a feature for managing **work items** related to cases needing review. The service relies on a **database** to store all information and communicates with **external APIs** for additional data, with its internal structure managed through **dependency injection**.
