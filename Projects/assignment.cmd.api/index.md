# Tutorial: assignment.cmd.api

This project acts as the **command processing** part of a larger system for managing driver **assignments** and **workdays/shifts**.
It receives instructions (*commands*) via *Kafka* (like `AcceptAssignmentCommand` or `ClockInCommand`).
It uses *Event Sourcing*, meaning it records every change as an *event* (e.g., `AssignmentAcceptedEvent`, `ClockInLoggedEvent`) instead of just saving the final state.
This allows reconstructing the history of any assignment or workday. It processes commands, updates the relevant *Assignment* or *Workday* state by adding new events, and then often publishes these events back to *Kafka* for other parts of the system.
