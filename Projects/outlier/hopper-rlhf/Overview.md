#### Step 1: Review your assigned language, locale and topic
- **Language**: You'll be given a specific language and locale.
- **Topic**: You'll be given a specific coding-related topic.
- **Purpose**: We are teaching the model to answer a variety of coding questions in a variety of languages so that it can perform well all over the workd!
- **Why This Matters**: Covering many topics makes the AI useful for people with different needs and interests. Your careful work here helps make the model more versatile!
#### Step 2: Write a Prompt
- **What is a Prompt?**: A prompt is a coding question that you write. It tells the AI what to talk about and how to respond.
- **Key Point**: Your prompt is the foundation of this task.

#### Step 3: Review Two AI Responses and Complete Two Jobs
Now, the AI will respond to your prompt twice. You'll review both responses carefully. You have to main tasks:
1. Code-Checking:
	- **Did the model provide the correct final answer?** Test whether the response provided the correct final answer.
	- **Did the model write out any incorrect steps or make incorrect reasoning steps?** Once the model generates a response to your prompt, review it carefully. Identify areas where the response falls short or makes mistakes. If one of the models does not have an issue, edit your prompt and try again until you make the model fail.
1. Proofreading:
	- Think of yourself as the "language expert".
	- Check for any unnatural language, awkward phrasing, or grammar errors in you language.
	- The AI might not speak your language perfectly, so look out for thing that sound odd or don't flow well.
	- Di it follow instructions correctly? Check that the AI stayed within the constraints and didn't make mistakes.
	- Is the information accurate? The AI sometimes gets facts wrong, so make sure everything is true and correct.
#### Step 4: Rate the Responses
After proofreading and fact-checking, you will rate each response based on how well it performed. Here's what to keep on mind:
- Provide a justification: Your explanation helps the AI understand what it did wrong.
- Side-by-Side Rating: If asked, compare both responses and select the better one. Explain why the chosen response is stronger or more accurate. A high-quality explanation helps improve the model.

#### Step 5: Improve the Selected Response
Finally, if the selected response has errors, you will have to edit to make it better. Here's what to do:
- Fix code errors: correct the incorrect step(s) clearly and concisely. The rewrite should be self-contained and understandable, following a logical sequence of reasoning.
- Correct Language Errors: Fix any grammar mistakes, spelling errors, or any fluency issues.
- Follow Instructions Precisely: Ensue that the AI's response matches all instructions perfectly.
- All Claims are Accurate: Make sure everything the model says is true and accurate.
Following these steps carefully will make a real difference in improving AI quality. Your attention to detail, accuracy, and fluency help create a model that is more helpful for everyone!
This instructions document will explain every step above in detail to make sure your tasks are high quality.
