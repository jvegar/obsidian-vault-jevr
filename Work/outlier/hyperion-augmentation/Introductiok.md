# **A Note About AI-Generated Starting Points**

  

For each deliverable, the task will provide up to 3 AI-written starting points for what a good problem statement/requirement/hint/plan could look like. **This is only meant to be a starting point.** The LLM is prone to hallucinations, repetition, and generalized statements, all of which we want to correct in our final responses.

  

You should leverage these starting points to write your finalized deliverable. Edits you should make include (but are not limited to):

  

- Synthesizing the best points from each LLM generated response
- Correcting any errors in LLM generated responses
- Increasing specificity when LLM generated responses are vague
- Removing irrelevant details from LLM generated responses

  

You may copy and paste text from the LLM generated responses into your final deliverable, but **you must edit the LLM’s starting point** before submission.
