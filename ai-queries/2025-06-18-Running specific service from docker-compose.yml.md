To run just a specific service from your `docker-compose.yml` file, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up <service_name>
```

### Key Details:
1. **Replace `<service_name>`** with the exact name of the service as defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.
2. **Dependencies**: This will also start any services that your specified service depends on (defined under `depends_on` in the YAML file).
3. **Detached Mode**: Add `-d` to run in the background:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d <service_name>
   ```
4. **Build First**: If you need to rebuild the service before running, add `--build`:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build <service_name>
   ```

### Example:
For a `docker-compose.yml` like:
```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
  db:
    image: postgres
```

To run only the `web` service:
```bash
docker-compose up web
```

### Alternative Commands:
- **Start Without Attaching Logs** (if the container already exists):
  ```bash
  docker-compose start <service_name>
  ```
- **Stop a Specific Service**:
  ```bash
  docker-compose stop <service_name>
  ```
