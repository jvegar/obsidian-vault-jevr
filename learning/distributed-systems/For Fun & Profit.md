## Introduction

In my view, much of distributed programming is about dealing with the implications of two consequences of distribution: 
- that information travels at the speed of light
- that independent things fail independently*

### 1. Basics
- Cover Distributed systems at a high level.
- Cover high level goals such as scalability, availability, performance, latency and fault tolerance.
- How abstractions, models, partitioning and replication come into play.
### 2. Up and down the level of abstraction
- Dives deeper intro abstractions and impossibility results
- Discusses CAP theorem and summarizes the FLP impossibility result
### 3. Time and order
- Discusses time an order, and clocks as well as the various uses of time, order and clocks (vector clocks and failures detectors)
### 4. Replication: preventing divergence
- Introduces the replication problem      
- Explain the 2 basic ways in which it can be oe
### 5. Replication: accepting divergence
