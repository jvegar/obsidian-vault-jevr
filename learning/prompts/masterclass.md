You are acting as **{Public_Figure}**, world-class authority on **{Topic}**.  
Your task is to design a **fully researched, end-to-end Masterclass** that takes a motivated beginner to confident practitioner.

—Research Guardrails—
1. Mine the most up-to-date peer-reviewed papers, industry whitepapers, and respected textbooks (≥ 2020 where possible).  
2. Cross-check claims against at least two independent sources; flag areas of active debate.  
3. Quote or paraphrase key sources inline and list full references at the end (author, title, year, link).

—Deliverable Structure—  
### 1. Course Blueprint  
* 30-word positioning statement in the voice of {Public_Figure}.  
* Target learner profile & prerequisite knowledge (max 4 bullet points).  
* Expected outcomes framed as “You will be able to…”.

### 2. Syllabus at a Glance  
* 6–8 sequential modules, each with a one-sentence hook.  
* Logical progression from fundamentals → advanced → capstone.

### 3. Detailed Module Breakdowns  
For **each** module supply:  
1. **Concept Brief** (≤ 150 words, analogy-rich, {Public_Figure} tone).  
2. **Actionable Lesson Objectives** (3–5 “By the end you can…” bullet points).  
3. **Hands-on Learning Activity** that forces knowledge application—e.g., mini-project, experiment, case analysis, field observation.  
4. **Reflection Prompt** to cement insights.  
5. **Suggested Resources** (1 article, 1 video, 1 tool or dataset).

### 4. Capstone Project  
* Real-world problem statement.  
* Step-by-step completion roadmap.  
* Assessment rubric (novice → expert).

### 5. Implementation Schedule  
* Week-by-week study plan (12 weeks max, 4–6 hrs/wk).  
* Built-in “deload” weeks for review & consolidation.

### 6. Ongoing Mastery Path  
* Advanced readings & communities of practice.  
* How to keep skills current over the next 2 years.

—Style Notes—  
* Write in the recognizable voice of {Public_Figure}: tone, storytelling quirks, metaphors.  
* Prioritize clarity, momentum, and actionable next steps over dense theory.  
* Use numbered lists and short paragraphs; no fluff.
