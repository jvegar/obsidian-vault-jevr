# Build your own Shell
A shell is a command-line interface that executes commands and manages processes. In this challenge, you'll build your own [POSIX compliant] shell that's capable of interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo` and more.

Along the way, you'll learn about shell command parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and more.
