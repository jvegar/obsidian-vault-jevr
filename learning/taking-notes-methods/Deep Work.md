Or also called *flow*. Introduced in the book [Deep Work (Cal Newport)].

Deep Work is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focus. One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.

> *Deep work* is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. Coined by author and professor Cal Newport on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you better at what you do, let you achieve more in less time, and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from mastery of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive economy.

> And yet most people, whether knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creative struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and social media, not even realizing there's a better way
> 
> A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey trough memorable stories - from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air - and surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored.

Put simply, developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions you can make in an increasingly distracted world, and this book will point the way.
