# virtual
The `virtual` keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or vent declaration and allow for it to be overriden in a derived class. For example, this method can be overriden by any class that inherits it:

```cs
public virtual double Area()
{
    return x*y;
}
```

The implementation of a virtual member can be changed by an overriding member in a derived class.
