# Tutorial: sar-service-event-sourced

This project implements a service for managing *Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)* cases using an **event sourcing** pattern.
Instead of storing the current state of a SAR case directly, it records every change as an immutable **event** in an *EventStore*.
**Projections** read these events to build specific, queryable views (read models) of the data, which are kept up-to-date by background **Workers**.
**Data Access Objects (DAOs)** provide a way to query these read models, and the service interacts with **External Service APIs** for additional information like user permissions.


**Source Repository:** [None](None)
