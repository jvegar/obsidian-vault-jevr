# 🧭 Tracking Progress & Evaluation

### 📌 Self-Evaluation Checklist

- Regularly journal your projects, mistakes, and lessons.
    
- Use the **Dreyfus model** (novice → expert) to assess skill depth.
    
- Compare your current project involvement against the expectations of senior roles (check company ladders, e.g., [Levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi)).
